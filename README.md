### Manage the stock of wishlist items with ease

This extension provides a set of features to make your Magento 2 backend user-friendly. 

##### All wishlists are stored in one place
The wishlists are in the form of a handy grid, where you can see the product type, the number of each item in stock and in wishlists, as well as of customers who plan to buy the item and more:

##### Save time and edit products right from the grid 
Sometimes you need to edit product info at once. With this feature, you will land on the product page immediately, right from the grid, just click Action_(Edit).

##### Stay informed about customers’ preferences
With Magento 2 Wishlist you will always be informed about the number of:
- times customers added a product to their wishlist (Count);
- expected items in stock (Qty)

With this extension enabled, you reduce the risk of supplying goods few people want. On the contrary, you know that these goods won’t stay in the store for long. 

##### Prevent dead stock
Why do you need to know how many customers added a product to their wishlists? In doing so you’ll deliver products that are wanted. This will reduce ‘dead’ stock instances. Check which items are most popular and refill the stock accordingly. This will help you reduce dead stock. Even if some buyers opt out of buying a product, you can use discounts and promotions to improve the product appeal for a wider range of customers, so never-sold stock will still be reduced. 

##### Streamline marketing activities
Don’t just store wishlists. Use them to generate insights about your customers. Analyze product count, differences in wishlists depending on the season, age, occupation, and other customer features to understand their needs better. This will help you deliver wanted products at the right time and improve their chances to be purchased. You can also use these insights to reshape your branding and marketing strategy to fit the audience.
